### ERD

> **Design Idea:** The admin will have a window in the dashboard in which he will create a new section, and add all of the course learning outcomes that go with it. The admin will then go to another window in which he will see all of the course learning outcomes that he has assigned to sections and map them with the appropiate student outcomes and program learning objectives. The instructors will then be able to view the new sections assigned to them, modify the section table and add records to the measure table.
